RTE+RRTMGP is a set of codes for computing radiative fluxes in planetary atmospheres. These pages provide a orientation to the code's architcture.

RTE [computes](./rte-solvers.html) radiative [_fluxes_](./rte-fluxes.html) given values of [_optical properties_](./rte-optical-props.html) , [_source functions_](./rte-optical-props.html), and boundary conditions.

[RRTMGP computes](./rte-optics) the optical properties and source functions of the gaseous atmosphere given the distribution of temperature, pressure, and gas concentrations within the atmosphere. RRTMGP includes models for the optics of clouds and aerosols.

Each of the italicized phrases above corresponds to a class in the Fortran 2003 interface which bundles some combination of code and data.
