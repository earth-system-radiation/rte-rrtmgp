#
# Accepts a list of environment modules and makes sure that they are
# loaded/unloaded. The function makes it easier to manipulate modules in
# non-interactive shell mode while transparently accounting for several common
# defects in the configuration of the environment module system:
#
#   1) if a module's name is prepended with the exclamation mark ('!') on the
#      argument list, the module is unloaded using the 'make unload' command
#      (helps in preparing the environment using a single command);
#
#   2) if a module is already loaded, it does not get reloaded (some
#      environments, e.g. Cray, are sensitive to the undocumented order of the
#      loaded modules and keeping an already loaded module instead of reloading
#      it is often safer);
#
#   3) if a module conflicts exactly one already loaded module, it gets loaded
#      using the 'module switch' command (this is often the only tested and
#      functional way to load a required module in some environments, e.g
#      PrgEnv-* modules on Cray);
#
#   4) if a module is in conflict with several already loaded modules, all
#      conflicting modules get unloaded first using the 'module unload' command
#      and then the required module is loaded using the 'module load' command;
#
#   5) if a module's name starts with 'PrgEnv-', it is considered to be in
#      conflict with any other module that has that prefix (on a Cray system, it
#      is important that only one PrgEnv module is loaded at a time, which is
#      normally covered with the mutual conflict statements in the respective
#      module files, however, that is not always the case).
