<p>This is the documentation for RTE+RRTMGP, a set of codes for computing radiative
fluxes in planetary atmospheres. The initial release of RTE+RRTMGP is described in a
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001621">paper</a>.
The code itself can be cited as
doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3403172">10.5281/zenodo.3403172</a> or via the
DOI attached to each release.</p>

<p>RRTMGP uses a k-distribution to provide an optical description (absorption and
possibly Rayleigh optical depth) of the gaseous atmosphere, along with the
relevant source functions, on a pre-determined spectral grid given
temperatures, pressures, and gas concentration. The k-distribution currently
distributed with this package is applicable to the Earthâ€™s atmosphere under
present-day, pre-industrial, and 4xCO2 conditions.</p>

<p>RTE computes fluxes given spectrally-resolved optical descriptions and source
functions. The fluxes are normally summarized or reduced via a user extensible class.</p>

<p>RTE+RRTMGP is a collaboration between Columbia University and Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. with support from a growing community including the German Climate Computing Center, Nvidia, and the Swiss Supercomputing Center.

<h1 id="documentation-is-always-a-work-in-progress">Documentation is always a work in progress</h1>

<p>We follow the <a href="https://diataxis.fr/">Diataxis</a> framework
and produce <a href="./tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a>, <a href="./how-tos/index.html">how-to guides</a>,
<a href="./explanations/index.html">explanations</a>, and <a href="./reference/index.html">reference</a>.</p>

<p>Much of the <a href="./reference/index.html">reference documentation</a> is
auto-generated from the code itself. This is provided separately for
RTE and RRTMGP and for the user-facing classes and underlying computational kernels.</p>

<p>We welcome contributions to the documentation via pull requests against the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch
of the Github repository.</p>
