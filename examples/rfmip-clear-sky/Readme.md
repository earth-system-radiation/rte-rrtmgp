# rfmip-rrtmgp
This directory contains programs and support infrastructure for running
the [RTE+RRTMGP](https://github.com/RobertPincus/rte-rrtmgp) radiation parameterization for the
[RFMIP](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/rfmip/) cases.

Note that this example is run, and the results checked automatically, when `make` is invoked in the root directory.

A Python script `stage_files.py` is used to download relevant files from the
[RFMIP web site](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/rfmip/resources/).This script invokes another Python script to create empty output files.

Use Python script `run-rfmip-examples.py` to run the examples. The script takes
some optional arguments, see `run-rfmip-examples.py -h`

Python script `compare-to-reference.py` will compare the results to reference
answers produced on a Mac with Intel 19 Fortran compiler. Differences are normally
within 10<sup>-6</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>.

The Python scripts require modules `netCDF4`, `numpy`, `xarray`, and `dask`.
Install with `pip` requires `pip install dask[array]` for the latter.
