Release [v1.9](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp/releases/tag/v1.9) makes the following user-facing changes:

- Adopts the `CMake` build system
- Vertical directionality (`top_at_1`) is encapsulated within the arrays of optical properties rather than carried as an indepdent variable.
- Cloud optical properties may be computed by-band (as before) or by g-point. New data is provided to allow computations by g-point.
- Ice sizes are labled to make clear they are diameter, not radius

As usual there are minor fixes and enhancements. Sergy Kosukhin of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology refined an initial CMake implementaion
by Makepath LLC. Sergy also keeps the continuous integration humming smoothly.

Development to this point has followed the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow);
starting with this release we're going to move instead to a single protected `main` branch and short-lived development branches.
This will include removing the `develop` and `documentation` branches.

The RTE+RRTMGP libraries and data are now distributed via `conda-forge` thanks to work by Makepath LLC.
