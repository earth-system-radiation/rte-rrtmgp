# minima

*Minima is a one-size-fits-all Jekyll theme for writers*. It's Jekyll's default (and first) theme. It's what you get when you run `jekyll new`.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minima"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
theme: minima
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/jekyll/minima. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test your theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme and the contents of the `example/` directory. As you make modifications to your theme and to the example site, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
