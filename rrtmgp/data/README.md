# About spectral data

This directory contains _k_-distributions for use with RRTMGP. Files with names ending in `2018-12-04` use the full spectral resolution of 16 g-points in each band. Files ending with
`210809` have half the spectral resolution (and hence take roughly half as much time to execute) but have somewhat larger errors. A more complete description of how the spectral
resolution was reduced and what the error characteristics are is included in a forthcoming manuscript.
