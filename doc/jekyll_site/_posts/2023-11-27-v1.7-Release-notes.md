Commit [3ac0636](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp/commit/3ac0636b17d6a3f11e4085f91679393fceaa4e18) 
to branch `main` makes the following changes:

- Libraries can be built in single precision by changes in `rte-kind/mo_rte_kind.F90`. Differences with respect to double precision are roughly 0.13 W/m2.  
- A class for computing the optical properties of aerosols following the MERRA representation has been added. 
- The repository is reorganized into `frontend` and `kernel` directories for `rte` and `rrtmgp`. Data has been moved to a separate [repository]((https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rrtmgp-data/). 
- Citation information has been added. 

As usual some bugs have been fixed, the use of OpenACC and OpenMP GPU offload directives continues to evolve, and the continous integration continues to be fine-tuned.
