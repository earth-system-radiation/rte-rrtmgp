  RTE+RRTMGP is a set of codes for computing radiative fluxes in
  planetary atmospheres. RRTMGP uses a k-distribution to provide an optical
  description (absorption and possibly Rayleigh optical depth) of the gaseous
  atmosphere, along with the relevant source functions, on a pre-determined
  spectral grid given temperatures, pressures, and gas concentration.
  RTE computes fluxes given spectrally-resolved optical descriptions and
  source functions.
