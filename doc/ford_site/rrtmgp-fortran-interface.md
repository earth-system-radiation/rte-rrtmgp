These pages provide a programmer's view of the Fortran user interface to RRTMGP.

RRTMGP provides a class [ty_gas_optics_rrtmgp](./type/ty_gas_optics_rrtmgp.html) that implements
the `gas_optics()` and other procedure(s) defined by the  [ty_gas_optics](./type/ty_gas_optics.html)
abstract class. The class is used to compute the spectrally-varying optical properties of the
gaseous atmosphere given temperature, pressure, and gas concentrations. Each instance of the
variable is ["loaded"](./type/ty_gas_optics_rrtmgp.html#boundprocedure-load) with data from netCDF
files in the `$RRTMGP_DATA` directory. Depending on the data provided the variable can be used
or radiation emitted by the atmosphere and surface ("longwave") of for for radiation emitted
by the planet's star ("shortwave").

The class implements both the longwave/internal sources and
shortwave/external sources versions of the
[`gas_optics`](./type/ty_gas_optics_rrtmgp.html#boundprocedure-gas_optics~2) procedure.
The longwave version reports Planck sources at layer centers and layer interfaces (levels)
while the shortwave version reports the spectrally-varying stellar radiation
Calling the longwave routine (by providing the longwave-relevant arguments)
when the variable has been initialized with shortwave data triggers a run-time error.

The user interface uses the [ty_gas_concs](./module/mo_gas_concentrations.html) type
to represent the volume mixing ratios needed as input. Output suitable for
scattering emission, two-stream, or multi-stream calculations are provided
depending on which sub-class of RTE's
[ty_optical_props_arry](../rte-fortran-interface/module/mo_optical_props.html#type-ty_optical_props_arry)
are provided. Planck source functions, if requested, are reported in a variable
of type [ty_source_func_lw.](../rte-fortran-interface/type/ty_source_func_lw.html)
