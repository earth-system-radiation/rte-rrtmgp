- New documentation site, partly hand-written (still essentially empty) and partly auto-generated from comments in code (partly complete).
- Workaround for Intel compilers on specific AMD processors
- Python dependencies made explicit in environment.yml files
- Move from wget to Python for downloading files in testing
- Public visibility and C-bindings restricted to just a few kernels
- Assorted consistency and prettifying
